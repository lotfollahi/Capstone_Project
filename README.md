Histopathology is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and determining initial directions for treatment. The high level of morphological detail present in stained biopsies enables pathologists to determine the presence of cancer. 
Standard histopathology steps consist of biopsy collection, tissue preparation and sectioning, the application of chemical stains, and analysis by an expert pathologists. This process is done manually and has some limitations: 
1) Time-consuming and susceptible to human error
2) Chemical stains are non-quantitative
3) Heavily relied upon in clinical assessment

The alternative approache is Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The  absorption spectra provide molecular fingerprints for each pixel, which translates to key cellular biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, DNA, collagen, glycogen, and carbohydrates. Each pixel contains the spectrum generated by a Fourier Transform.
